# Specifying a `step` is useful especially when working with non-stationary but slow-moving distributions. The `step`
# argument will never reduce the number of folds below 1. The `n_splits` argument sets the `upper limit` on the number
# of folds created; fewer folds may be produced, depending on the outer range of the available data.

# You may also use cron directly to filter a weekday based on the date. For example, ``'0 0 * * THU#2'`` will select the
# second Thursday of every month.
